Create a small dataset about total sales over the last year. The format of the dataset should be a data frame with 12 rows and 2 columns. The columns should be called "month" and "total_sales_usd". The "month" column should contain the shortened forms of month names from "Jan" to "Dec". The "total_sales_usd" column should contain random numeric values taken from a normal distribution with mean 100000 and standard deviation 5000. Provide Python code to generate the dataset, then provide the output in the format of a markdown table.
